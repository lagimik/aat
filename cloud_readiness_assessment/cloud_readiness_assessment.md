# Top 10 Questions to Ask a Customer

The following is a working draft of the questions to ask a prospective, or current, Azure customer to anticipate where they are going to struggle and how they can be supported.

The following questions will help group customers into the following groups:
1. Pre-Foundation:
* Leverage AAT conversations around key topics to educate and orient customer on next steps.
2. Foundation
* Use foundation AAT content
3. Intermediate : foundation, but no operational plan
* Leverage Operations AAT content
4. Advance: foundation + operational + IaaS to PaaS
* Cloudyn to optimize the $
* Automation to manage

It is a measure of how crucial this is to them at this time.|
|3. What are they KPI for the cloud strategy?|Level 1 - proof of concepts <br> Level 2 - cost savings <br> Level 3 <br> Level 4- Market penetration by accelerating application deliverr |This is a measure of the expectations the customer has with respect to cloud|
|4. What is the reason looking at Azure?|Level 0 - learning <br> Level 1 - competitive feature comparison <br> Level 2 -  <br> Level 3 - weighted cost comparison <br> Level 4 - mission critical workload <br>|	This is an indicator of how much the customer is willing to change their ways of doing things.|
|5. What is your cloud adoption plan?|	Level 1 - they do not have a plan <br> Level 1 - competitive feature comparison <br> Level 2 -  <br> Level 3 - weighted cost comparison <br> Level 4 - mission critical workload <br>	This is a measure of the degree of awareness of the transformation required to leverage the benefits of cloud.|

|10 . Which group current has the most impact on the application lifecycle?|	Level 1 - infrastructure<br>Level 2 - security <br> Level 3 - development / QA <br> Level 4 - Feature team |This is an indication of the influence of different silos and the degree of change required.|
