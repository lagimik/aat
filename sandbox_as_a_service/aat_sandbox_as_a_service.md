Engagement Model
================

 

The sandbox-as-a-service is not a technology deliverable; it is a controlled experiment within an organization to co-develop the change plan required to adopt cloud. Through this experiential learning approach the required awareness and changes in perspective can begin to take place. This in turn will help inform the plan for broader adoption of cloud for other workloads.

 

Organizational Current State
============================

 

The following is a qualification, or self-qualification, checklist for engaging with a Sandbox-as-a-Service model:

 

-   Executive management is driving towards production cloud workload capabilities in the near term without understanding the initial transformation, and ongoing evolution required in terms of people, process, and technology.

-   The traditional IT service lines of security, networking, compute, and storage do not share a common understanding of the operational and technology changes required.

-   Obtaining internal security, architectural, and project governance approvals for candidate cloud workload would require more than 2 weeks.

-   Based on historical patterns, unless there is a significant event, or crisis, it would be difficult to identify compelling and motivating reasons to adopt new IT delivery practices.

>  

If any of the above statement apply, the sandbox-as-a-service can help the organization overcome the first obstacles or cloud adoption.

Sandbox
=======

 

The sandbox is a contained workload delivering on a business outcome. Some examples of a sandbox could include:

-   An isolated developer VM

-   An all-in-one deployment of a business or research application

-   A multi-tier web-based application

-   A PaaS-based web service and database for persistence

-   A microservice for a specific business function

 

Motivation for sandbox use could include:

-   Testing complex, or high-risk, upgrades scenarios requiring environment wipes and resets

-   Exploratory work with new services or technology

-   Collaboration with external parties

 

 

Sandbox-as-a-Service
====================

Perhaps more significant than the implementations of the sandbox are the service management characteristics implied by sandbox-as-a-service. Some key differences, and organizational hurdles follow:

 

-   **Self-Service:** a sandbox is provisioned on demand by the Consumer. This eliminates the lead time normally associated to IT service provisioning. This is a key aspect of the cloud model which will be piloted using sandboxes.

 

-   **Service Provisioning:** a sandbox is an isolated environment. The service includes the installation of the sandbox and the necessary identity and network access. The service does not include any support within the sandbox. The sandbox has to be operated independently. The archiving, documentation and/or export of the knowledge gained or configurations made must be carried out by the consumer. Backup and restore services are not offered.

 

-   **Service Lifecycle**: a sandbox has a maximum duration of 6 months. Extension of the contract period is possible by exception. The sandbox is automatically switched off and deleted after the specified period of time. Conversion into a productive or test environment is excluded.

 

-   **Costs and Billing**: paid cloud services are purchased within a sandbox. The *Consumer* agrees on the costs incurred in advance, both professionally and in terms of accounting. In the case of self-installed software, sufficient licensing must be ensured.

 

-   **Compliance:** within the sandbox it is forbidden to process or collect personal as well as business critical information. If company data is required within the sandbox, it must first be manipulated or made unrecognizable. Divisions or country-specific compliance approvals must be obtained prior to ordering. The sandbox is not monitoring for compliance violations, but the *Provider* reserves the right to inspect the materials deposited within the sandbox and to delete them for legitimate reasons.

 

 

Value of a Sandbox-as-a-Service
===============================

-   *Consumer* does not require long lead time to fulfill the request.

-   *Consumer* does not need to spend time building the components of the service

-   *Consumer* does not require an understanding of the sandbox implementation

-   *Consumer* can instantiate as many sandboxes are required

-   *Consumer* benefit from the incremental improvements made by the Provider based on:

    -   The vendor patching cadence

    -   the collective feedback of Consumer.

-   *Consumer* benefits from the consistency between *Provider* sandbox services and eventual production services.

-   *Provider* can embed requisite controls through policy

-   *Provider* does not focus on how the consumer will use it

-   *Provider* does not need to plan for long term use.

-   *Consumer and Provider* are confident in the isolated nature of the sandbox

 

Defining the Sandbox-as-a-Service - A Hackathon Approach
========================================================

 

Defining the initial services and identifying policy, process, and technology gaps is not a simple or individual task. It is recommended that the definition of the sandbox-as-a-service be conducted through a cross-functional team, and partner department / line of business as an early adopter, to define and deliver the Sandbox-as-a Service offering as part of a multiday hackathon.

 

The outcome of the hackathon will be the first version of the sandbox, which will be evolved going forward.

 

  **Sandbox Hackathon Outcomes**

  Tangible and relevant offering than can be leveraged by partners and clients immediately
  Demonstrates a 1-stop-shop, end-to-end, cloud service offering.
  Sandbox is isolated by nature to allow to safely learn alternate approaches. \#failforward
  Delivering sandbox to cloud provides a full platform learning and development opportunity
