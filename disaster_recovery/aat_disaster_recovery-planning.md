Disaster Recovery Planning
==========================

Disaster recovery relates to measures taken to ensure that operations can be resumed in the event of a catastrophic failure such as the loss of a primary data center.

Guidance
--------

* The Business Impact Assessment (BIA) and Risk Assessment (RA) define requirements in terms of people, process, and technology in support of business continuity and disaster recovery.

* Establish a cross-functional disaster recovery Team. Key stakeholders participation during DR planning is critical to understanding and weighing business, compliance, risk and technical considerations when planning for Disaster Recovery. Stakeholders should include, at a minimum: Business Stakeholders, Risk & Compliance, and IT Application and Infrastructure.


Next Steps
----------

1. Conduct a [Business Impact and Risk Assessment](e) to define *recovery time objectives* and *recovery point objectives* for key business functions and processes

2. Conduct a [Technical Dependency Analysis]() to identify the technology services and applications used to delivery the business functions and processes in scope and their existing recovery capabilities, and gaps to the stated business recovery objectives.

3. Conduct a [Component Failure Analysis]() to identify high impact services and single points of failure.
