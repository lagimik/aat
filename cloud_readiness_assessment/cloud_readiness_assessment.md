# Top 10 Questions to Ask a Customer

The following is a working draft of the questions to ask a prospective, or current, Azure customer to anticipate where they are going to struggle and how they can be supported.

The following questions will help group customers into the following groups:
1. Pre-Foundation:
* Leverage AAT conversations around key topics to educate and orient customer on next steps.
2. Foundation
* Use foundation AAT content
3. Intermediate : Foundation, but no operational plan
* Leverage Operations AAT content
4. Advanced: Foundation + Operational + IaaS to PaaS
* Cloudyn to optimize the $
* Automation to manage

|Question|	Rating	|Rationale|
|--------|----------|---------|
|1. Who is leader this cloud related effort |Level 1 - IT Director <br> Level 2 - CIO Level <br> 3- CEO/GM <br> Level 4 - Board level directive <br> |Many of the changes required to adopt cloud are beyond the authority of a single role in an organization. This is a measure of the amount of change a cloud initiative can hope to have.|
|2. What business outcomes are you hoping to realize through cloud? |	Level 1 - Technical <br> Level 2 - Cost Savings <br> Level 3 - Risk Mitigation (Breach, Availability/DR, Scale) <br> Level 4 - Digital Transformation Scenarios	|The reason for considering cloud sheds light into how much of a vested interest they have in the adoption being successful. It is a measure of how crucial this is to them at this time.|
|3. What are they KPI for the cloud strategy?|Level 1 - proof of concepts <br> Level 2 - cost savings <br> Level 3 <br> Level 4- Market penetration /Revenue growth/Improved services to citizens  |This is a measure of the expectations the customer has with respect to cloud|
|4. What is the reason looking at Azure?|Level 0 - learning <br> Level 1 - competitive feature comparison <br> Level 2 -  <br> Level 3 - weighted cost comparison <br> Level 4 - mission critical workload <br>|	This is an indicator of how much the customer is willing to change their ways of doing things.|
|5. What is your cloud adoption plan?|	Level 1 - they do not have a plan <br> Level 1 - competitive feature comparison <br> Level 2 -  <br> Level 3 - weighted cost comparison <br> Level 4 - mission critical workload <br>	This is a measure of the degree of awareness of the transformation required to leverage the benefits of cloud.|
|6. What is your talent plan for Cloud ?|	Level 1 - same<br> Level 2 - training <br> Level 3 - hiring <br> Level 4 - training and hiring|	This is a measure of how transformational they believe the move to cloud to be. Current staff is likely at least 70% utilized and will only have 30% to devote to the Cloud effort.
|7. Do you have a target service delivery plan or operating model?|	Level 1 - Managed Outsourcing <br> Level 2 - Current ITIL/ITSM <br> Level 3 - <br> Level 4 - [Cloud Service Foundation](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/cloudsolutions/2013/08/15/cloud-services-foundation-reference-architecture-reference-model/)	|This is a measure of the impact on current vendors relationships and processes. The lower on the scale, the harder the operating model will be to change.|
|8. How will cloud operations  be integrated into standard operating procedures? ( Security, Monitoring, Backup recovery, business continuity, DevOps).|Level 1 - each operations will be isolated from each other <br> Level 2 - leverage existing on-premise capabilities to manage cloud <br> Level 3 -increase level of automation <br> Level 4 - leverage cloud capabilities to manage on premise operations |	This is a relative measure to the customer's own operations as opposed to a an external benchmark. This ensures that customers  aren't held to unrealistic external standards.|
|9. Foundational readiness: <br>a.  Have you extended network?<br>b. Have you integrated your on premise identities with Azure AD? <br> c. Have you integrated your cloud logs with your SIEM or Security Operations Center (SOC)?|	Level 1 - nothing <br> Level 2 - (a.) is complete <br> Level 3 - (a.) + (b.) are complete <br> Level 4 - (a.) + (b.) + (c.) are complete|	This is a measure of the readiness of their technical foundation|
|10 . Which group current has the most impact on the application lifecycle?|	Level 1 - infrastructure<br>Level 2 - security <br> Level 3 - development / QA <br> Level 4 - Feature team |This is an indication of the influence of different silos and the degree of change required.|
|11. What Best Describes your IT Service ChargeBack Process? |Maturity 1: No ChargeBack process.<br>Maturity 2: Process in place to assign costs for static Service allocations back to business groups; based on capacity not usage, or based on show-back reporting.<br> Maturity 3: ChargeBack based on cost of resources allocated and consumed, charged in aggregated or abstracted units using a defined Service Catalog (e.g., VM months). <br> Maturity 4: Real-time monitoring of IT systems with ChargeBack of actual resource utilization to business groups consuming IT Services (e.g., CPU, storage, & network utilization).| This is a measure of the current transparency and management of IT related expenses|
|12. What is your strategy for application portfolio management and rationalization?| Maturity 1: Low visibility is offered into application inventory and an ad hoc approach to portfolio management is followed.<br> Maturity 2: Basic governance is established and an application inventory exists. <br> Maturity 3: Standards are implemented and an enterprise architect function is established. Costs are measured and used to establish budgets. All applications are fully supported.<br> Maturity 4: Duplicate functionality across applications is eliminated, and applications are tightly aligned to business capabilities. An application portfolio is proactively managed based on upcoming business and technology changes.| This is measure of the investment rigour in IT capabilities|
|13. What best describes your strategy for IT service operations and service-level agreements? |Maturity 1: Service-level or operational-level agreements are not formally managed.<br> Maturity 2: Each IT service provides service-level and operational-level agreements.<br> Maturity 3: Service-level and operational-level agreements are integrated for IT services; management reviews operational health regularly; some tasks are automated. <br> Maturity 4: Reporting on service-level and operational-level agreements occurs in real time across the organization; IT services are provisioned dynamically to provide the required levels of reliability and scalability; all tasks that can be automated are automated.| This describes if the IT organization is currently managing <i>server availability<i/> vs <i>service availability</i>.|
|14. What best describes your risk and vulnerability management strategy for IT services? |Maturity 1: Risk and vulnerability analysis of IT service confidentiality, integrity, and availability is not formally managed; IT compliance objectives and activities are not defined.<br> Maturity 2: Risk and vulnerability are formally analyzed across IT services; IT compliance objectives and activities are defined and audited for each IT service.<br>  Maturity 3: Risk and vulnerability analysis is integrated across all IT services; IT compliance objectives and activities are integrated across IT services and automated where possible; management regularly audits to review policy and compliance.<br> Maturity 4: Risks and vulnerabilities are analyzed across all IT services against developed models; compliance objectives and activities are automated, and then updated automatically based on changes to IT policies.|
|15. How integrated are your application development and operations environments, processes, and teams? |Maturity 1: Little alignment between application development and operations teams exists, with ad hoc integration supported by manual processes.  Development teams specify requirements for operating environments for each application with little consideration of existing operating environments.<br> Maturity 2: Processes are defined for debugging production defects and incidents, with a standard set of defect artifacts.<br> Maturity 3: An integrated platform exists between development and operations for application monitoring, incident reporting and management, actionable defect/incident data from monitored applications, communication through support to development teams, and ubiquitous visibility into issue resolution status. <br> Maturity 4: Application telemetry data from production applications is used by engineering to guide defect fixes, understanding of feature use, and inform future iterations of the application design.| Organizations with established silos will struggle to define a new operating model|
|16. What best describes your infrastructure and application workload deployment and provisioning strategy? | Maturity 1: Manual build, deployment, and provisioning processes; manual reporting on these processes.<br> Maturity 2: Automated build with defined deployment and provisioning processes.<br> Maturity 3: Automated build and deployment with consistent provisioning processes integrated with software and configuration library that includes virtual images; on demand reporting; self service portal for IT or end users to deploy.<br> Maturity 4: Automated build, deployment and provisioning processes with orchestration to configure new instances of services based on a template that can be composed of multiple virtual images; real time reporting.|This is a measure of the existing capabilities around managing infrasturcture as code|
